# Yo, I’m Hadji ✌🏾  

This is just my GitHub. Nothing crazy — a mix of projects I actually finished, ones I’m still convincing myself I’ll finish, and some experiments that probably belong in the trash but are still here anyway.  

Not a polished showcase. More like: “here’s what happens when curiosity, caffeine, and a bit of chaos collide.”

### 🛠️ How I Work  
- If it runs: I take full credit.  
- If it breaks: must’ve been the AI’s fault.  
- AI “help” = half genius, half comedy skit.  
- Google + StackOverflow = my unofficial co-authors.

So yeah — scroll around, fork something, laugh at the chaos, or just leave knowing you’ve witnessed peak “work in progress” energy.  

**PS:** If you clone anything and it breaks, congrats… you’ve unlocked the full Hadji experience.
